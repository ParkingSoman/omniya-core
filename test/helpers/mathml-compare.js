/**
 * Structural MathML comparison for the Nemeth corpus gate.
 *
 * This is the comparison MathCAT's maintainer proposed for exactly this
 * problem: round-trip our LaTeX through the same MathJax pipeline the app
 * already uses, canonicalize both sides through the app's own MathML tree
 * utilities, and compare structurally rather than by string.
 *
 *   parseNemeth(cells).latex
 *     -> convertLatexToMathML(latex)     [src/main/mathml.js, ASYNC]
 *     -> canonicalizeMathML(...)         [src/domain/math-tree.js]
 *     -> parseMathML(...)                [src/domain/math-tree.js]
 *     -> structuralEquivalent(ours, theirs)  [src/domain/math-tree.js]
 *
 * The case's own `mathml` goes through the same canonicalizeMathML ->
 * parseMathML steps, so both sides are normalized identically.
 *
 * `structuralEquivalent` already strips `data-omniya-id` and unwraps a
 * single-child unannotated `mrow`. Everything below adds exactly four more
 * rules on top of that, each named, scoped narrowly, and verified against
 * the actual corpus and the actual MathJax output before being written (see
 * the comments on each rule, and test/unit/helpers/mathml-compare.test.js
 * for the proof that none of them masks a real difference). This file does
 * not touch `src/domain/`, and `src/domain/` never imports from `src/main/`
 * -- that boundary is unaffected by these tests living here.

 * the element carries no visible mathematics, so it must be removed as a

 * with no counterpart on the other side, which would itself cause a false
 * DISAGREE. Scoped to exactly these two codepoints, as an <mo> whose sole

 * are bare `<math>...</math>` snippets, not full documents). `xmlns` is in

 * `mathcat-rules:baseline_80_a_1` (`\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}`) is otherwise
 * byte-for-byte structurally identical on both sides, and only this
 * attribute made it compare unequal. A namespace declaration is not

/**
 * Rule 4: inline an unannotated `<mrow>` that is a node's ONLY child.
 *
 * Presentation MathML defines several elements (`<msqrt>`, `<mtd>`, `<math>`
 * itself, ...) as taking either one child representing a whole expression,
 * or -- equivalently, per the spec's own content model -- several children
 * that are implicitly treated as if wrapped in one `<mrow>`. So
 * `<msqrt><mrow>A B C</mrow></msqrt>` and `<msqrt>A B C</msqrt>` are the same
 * tree. `structuralEquivalent`'s own built-in rule only covers the mirror
 * case (an `<mrow>` with exactly one grandchild collapses to that
 * grandchild); it does not cover an `<mrow>` with *several* grandchildren
 * that is itself its parent's only child. The corpus itself proves this is
 * pure serialization noise, not content: `mathcat-rules:sqrt_103_a_2` writes
 * `<msqrt><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>y</mi></mrow></msqrt>` (wrapped)
 * while `mathcat-rules:sqrt_103_a_4` writes the mathematically-analogous
 * `<msqrt><msup>..</msup><mo>+</mo><msup>..</msup></msqrt>` (unwrapped, no
 * `<mrow>` at all) for the same shape of expression -- the same source
 * treats the two forms as interchangeable. Scoped to "parent has exactly one
 * child, and it is an mrow with no attributes besides `data-omniya-id`" so
 * it can never fire on a fixed-arity element like `<msup>`/`<mfrac>` (those
 * always have >= 2 children, so this never matches them), and never
 * discards an `<mrow>` that carries its own semantic attributes.
