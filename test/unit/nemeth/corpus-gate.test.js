// The corpus gate: grades the parser against all 613 cases in the Tier-1
// correctness corpus. Every case lands in exactly one of four buckets --
// PASS, REFUSE, DISAGREE, ERROR (see scripts/nemeth-coverage.mjs for the
// exact definitions). Most cases REFUSE today because the parser supports a
// deliberately narrow slice; that is expected and correct.
//
// What this file actually gates is DISAGREE and ERROR, not PASS: a REFUSE
// is an honest "not supported yet", but a DISAGREE is the parser silently
// producing wrong mathematics, and an ERROR is the parser claiming success
// while handing MathJax LaTeX it rejects. Both are bugs. Neither is allowed
// to exist un-looked-at -- each must be named here with a reason, or this
// test fails. Widening either allowlist is a decision for a human to make

// correctly discards non-mathematical detail (a leading/trailing space is
// formatting, not content; more than one MathML encoding can render
// identically), so distinct MathML inputs collapse to identical cells.
// Running the corpus in reverse (cells -> our parsed MathML) is therefore
// inherently ambiguous for any case whose MathML differs from another only

// several equally-valid source MathML trees produced them, and there is

// below is one instance of this collapse, verified against the corpus
// itself, not guessed -- and DISAGREE = 0 is therefore not always an
