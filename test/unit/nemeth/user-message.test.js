/**
 * `userMessage` is what the composer shows when a commit is refused.
 *
 * The rule this encodes is narrower than the one it replaces. `errors.js` used
 * to say `detail` "must never reach an end user", for a reason that still
 * holds: an author who hits a construct this pipeline cannot read should be
 * told to write LaTeX, not handed a rule number to look up. But that rule was
 * written as though every refusal were such a construct, and the alpha log of
 * 2026-08-24 showed it is not -- a missing baseline indicator was reported as
 * a bug against the app, because the app said "not supported yet" about an
 * expression it parses correctly once the cell is there.
 *
 * So: a call site that can name what is missing in plain words sets
 * `userDetail`, and every site that cannot keeps the single sentence. There is
 * no error taxonomy and no mapping table -- a new `unsupported()` call site
 * without a `userDetail` behaves exactly as it does today, which is what keeps
 * this from rotting as the parser grows.
