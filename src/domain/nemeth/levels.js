/**
 * Assign a script level to every token and drop the level indicators themselves.
 *
 * A level is an ABSOLUTE PATH from the baseline, held as a string over the
 * alphabet `^` (superscript) and `_` (subscript): `''`, `'^'`, `'_'`, `'^^'`,
 * `'^_'`, ... This is not a stylistic choice. BANA Rule 2's indicator table
 * (test/corpus/sources/Nemeth_2022.txt lines 652-670) enumerates the level
 * indicators as a closed set of absolute paths -- "Superscript with Subscript"
 * is one indicator meaning the subscript slot of a superscript, not "up then
 * down". Under a signed-integer model `x_a^n` computes -1 + 1 = 0 and parses
 * silently as `x_a n`; under paths it is `'_'` then `'^'`, two depth-1 siblings
 * of `x`, and the wrong reading is not expressible.
 *
 * This pass only LABELS. Which base owns which script is the parser's job, and
 * with paths that question reduces to a prefix comparison.
 *
 * Level is therefore NOT a pure function of the level-indicator tokens. Rule
 * 14.6 (lines 6420-6439) states that a first-order numeric subscript is written
 * with no subscript indicator at all, so `⠭⠂` is x sub 1 (Example 14-36) with
 * nothing in the cells to say so. That promotion is level labelling, not
 * grammar, so it happens here; see `startsImplicitSubscript`.
 *
 * `afterBaseline` records that an explicit baseline indicator immediately
 * preceded the token -- through an intervening level indicator, because that is
 * exactly the shape Rule 14.11.2 (lines 7263-7267) defines: Example 14-124
 * (line 7269) writes non-simultaneous scripts as `a~n";m` -- baseline
 * indicator, then subscript indicator. It is the sole carrier of the `x_1^2`
 * vs `(x_1)^2` distinction and is unrecoverable once the indicators are gone;
 * `parser.js` consumes it.
 *
 * A BLANK is a level event too, and only sometimes. Rule 14.8 enumerates which
 * spaces reset the level and which preserve it: 14.8.7 (lines 6907-6911) a space
 * followed by a comparison symbol "initiates the baseline level"; 14.8.4 (line
 * 6787) a space after a shape or a function name preserves it; 14.8.5 (line
 * 6852) a space partitioning a numeral preserves it; 14.8.6 (line 6860) a space
 * around an ellipsis or long dash preserves it; and 14.8.8 (line 6947) "Any
 * other symbol or situation preserves the level that is already in effect."
 * Only 14.8.7 is implemented, because it is the only one whose neighbouring
 * construct this pass can identify from a symbol row; the rest fall to 14.8.8's
 * preserve, which is also what they ask for. 14.8.3 (lines 6744-6749), the reset
 * before literary or unrelated text, needs a notion of text this pipeline does
 * not have.
 *
 * `⠐` is both the baseline indicator (Rule 2) and the multipurpose indicator
 * (Rule 24). This pass does not have to choose: on the level it does the same
 * thing either way (returning to the baseline is a no-op when already there),
 * and Rule 24.1's one job at the baseline -- 24.1.b, "used between a letter and
 * a succeeding numeric symbol to indicate that the corresponding numeral is not
 * a subscript" (lines 11919-11926; Example 24-1 at line 11927 is `⠭⠐⠢`) -- is
 * to suppress the Rule 14.6 promotion above, and `afterBaseline` expresses
 * that directly.

 * proves one of them fails -- and the only one that can fail without leaving a
 * trace in these very cells is (c), the base. Example 14-45 (line 6514) is
 * exactly that: `seven;3` carries the indicator "because condition c does not
 * hold", the base being the word "seven" and not the letter that happens to sit
 * against the indicator. Reading it as that letter would hand on a subscript
 * hung off the wrong base, so it is refused instead.
 *
 * Condition (d) is what the digit walk tests: only a run that ends the input or
 * ends at a baseline indicator is numeric-only with no scripts of its own. A
 * run followed by an operator, a letter or a further level indicator is one of
 * Examples 14-46 to 14-49, where the indicator is genuinely required.
