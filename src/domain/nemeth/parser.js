/**
 * Token[] -> AST. Recursive descent, single pass, no backtracking, no modes.
 *
 * Grammar:
 *   expression := terms ( BLANK comparison BLANK terms )*
 *   terms      := postfix ( OP? postfix )*
 *   postfix    := primary script*
 *   primary    := Number | Identifier | Fraction | Root | Fenced | FunctionCall
 *
 * The two productions are BANA's two spacing rules, not a precedence ladder.
 * Rule 21.13 (Nemeth_2022.txt lines 10775-10779) spaces a comparison sign on
 * both sides; Rule 20.1.2 (line 9964) leaves no space beside an operation sign
 * except in the five circumstances 20.1.1 lists (lines 9916-9963), none of
 * which this parser reads. So a blank is grammar, not whitespace: it is exactly
 * what tells `⠨⠅` the equals sign from `⠨⠅` the Greek letter kappa, and
 * dropping or collapsing one would turn `⠎⠊⠝⠀⠭` into `sinx` and
 * `⠼⠲⠲⠀⠒⠢⠆` into a single numeral.
 *
 * `expression` is FLAT: one `Sequence` holding operands and operators in source
 * order, never a nested one. There are no precedence tiers, because grouping by
 * precedence is an assertion about operator binding, and Nemeth does not encode
 * it -- the code is structurally explicit (this fraction has this numerator) and
 * semantically silent (it never says that is division over the reals). The
 * target is Presentation MathML, which is flat for the same reason:
 * `<mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>b</mi></mrow>`. Tier nesting would have made
 * `Sequence` -- the node whose contract is that it asserts nothing -- the one
 * place binding got asserted.
 *
 * An operator between two operands is therefore optional and carries no weight:
 * `a+b` and `ab` differ only in whether an `Operator` item sits between them.
 * What the loop does still enforce is that an operator has an operand on each
 * side, so `a+` and `+a` are refused rather than yielding a dangling item.
 *
 * Scripts are attached here, not in `levels.js`: a token at level `P + '^'`
 * belongs to the base parsed at level `P`, which is a prefix test on the
 * absolute level paths. A script operand is a `postfix`, not a full expression
 * -- a relation inside a script has to restate its own level indicator, which
 * is out of scope.
 *
 * Whether two scripts on one base are simultaneous is NOT read off the level
 * paths -- both readings put the scripts at the same two levels. The explicit
 * baseline indicator is the only thing that separates them, and `levels.js`
 * hands it over as `afterBaseline`; `parsePostfix` is where it is consumed.
 *
 * One production of the designed grammar is absent because no symbol row can
 * reach it yet, and an unreachable branch is a place for a wrong guess to hide:
 * `unary := (+|-|±)? postfix`, which needs a row marking an operator as usable
 * as a prefix. It is an addition to this file when that row arrives.
